    "# 5 Temporal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, time is measured in a system of units determined by calendars and clocks. A calendar measures multiples of days whereas a clock subdivides a day into smaller units. The notion of \"telling time\" associates a time to a number in the system of units provided by some choice of calendar and clock. We call such a value a temporal type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers know that it is most convenient to put the calendar and clock together to have a single measure of time on all scales – i.e., UTC. In common practice, calendar and clock measurements can be made separately where the full scale is not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system of calendars and clocks is a hodge-podge based on early astronomy. We measure days by counting rotations of the earth on its axis and years by counting revolutions of the Earth. Months evolved from lunar cycles tracking the changes in the phase of the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imposed on this is a sexagesimal counting system originated by the ancient Sumerians, who were evidently fond of 12. There were (almost) 360 days in a year and exactly 12 hours of daylight and darkness at equinox. There are 60 minutes in an hour. This was good enough for farmers and astronomers to predict sun and moon cycles 4000 years ago. Increased accuracy of clocks has forced us to adopt leap years, leap seconds and other adjustments to make things come out right. Social and legal customs result in differentiating days into various categories such as business days and holidays. Time zones attempt to make clock time correspond to sunlight and the legislative lunacy of daylight savings time shifts clocks with no actual benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer systems have tried to map this mess into the ordered world of bits with varying levels of success. With the advent of nanosecond-based temporal types, time measurement in q is now logical and consistent in that all temporal values are integral counts. These counts are offsets from millennium and midnight, not some point in the 1970s when a system designer realized something had to be done about time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q handles time series and relational data in a consistent and efficient manner. It extends the basic SQL date and time data types to facilitate temporal operations, which are minimal in SQL and can be clumsy in traditional languages (e.g., Java's original date library and its time zones).\n",
    "\n",
    "## date\n",
    "A date is stored as a four-byte signed integer and is denoted by yyyy.mm.dd, where yyyy represents the year, mm the month and dd the day. The underlying value is the count of days from Jan 1, 2000 – positive for post-millennium and negative for pre."

    "## Overview of Nulls\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a null value generally indicates missing data. This is an area in which q differs from both traditional programming languages and SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such languages as C++, Java and C#, the concept of a null value applies to complex entities (i.e., objects) that are allocated on the heap and accessed by pointer or reference. A null pointer corresponds to an unallocated entity, meaning that it has not been assigned the address of an initialized block of memory. (Tony Hoare, who introduced the concept of null pointer, calls it his \"billion dollar mistake.\") There is no concept of null for entities that are of value type. For those types that admit null, you test for null by asking if the value is equal to a special null marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NULL` value in SQL indicates that data is not present. The `NULL` value is distinct from any value that can actually be contained in a field and it does not have '=' semantics. That is, you do not test a field for null with = `NULL.` Instead, you ask if it `IS NULL`. Because `NULL` is a separate value, Boolean fields, for example, actually have three states: `0`, `1` and `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The q situation is more interesting. There are no references or pointers, so the notion of an unallocated entity does not arise. Most types have null values that are distinct from \"normal\" values and occupy the same amount of storage. Some types do not designate a distinct null value because there is no available bit pattern – i.e., for boolean, byte and char all underlying bit patterns are meaningfully employed. In this case, the value with no information content serves as a proxy for null.\n",

    "## Binary Nulls\n",
    "The binary types have no null values. There is no room since every bit pattern is a legitimate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numeric and Temporal Nulls\n",
    "The numeric and temporal types have their own designated null values. Here the situation is similar to SQL, in that you can distinguish missing data from data whose underlying value is zero. In contrast, there is no universal null value and q nulls take the same space as non-nulls.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of the q approach is that the null values act like other values in expressions. The tradeoff is that you must use the correct null value in type-checked situations.\n",

    "Considering a symbol as variable length text justifies that the symbol null is the empty symbol, designated by a naked back-tick **`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null value for the char type is the blank character `\" \"`. As with binary data, you cannot distinguish between a missing char value and a blank value. Again, this is not seriously limiting in practice, but you should ensure that your application does not rely on this distinction.\n",

    "\n",
    "The value `\"\"` is not a null char. It is an empty list of char.\n",

    "You could test for null using `=` but this requires a null literal of correct type. Because q is dynamically typed, this can result in problems if a variable changes type during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use the unary `null` to test a value for null, as opposed to `=`, as it provides a type-independent check. Also, you don't have to remember the funky null literals."
